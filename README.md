## 📖 Introduction
Classical cryptography (RSA, AES) is *at risk from quantum computers* which can break them using algorithms like *Shor’s algorithm*.  
This project introduces *Quantum-Safe PKI* powered by *Quantum Cryptography* — ensuring future-proof, unbreakable security.
---
## 🚨 Problem Statement
- Current encryption methods are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.  
- Sensitive data in *banking, defense, healthcare* must be secured.  
- Future internet requires *quantum-proof security*.
---
## ✅ Solution
Our React application demonstrates *Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)* and *quantum-safe principles*:
- 🔑 *Safe Key Exchange* → Quantum states detect any eavesdropping.  
- 🛡️ *Unbreakable Encryption* → Physics > Mathematics.  
- 🌐 *Future-Proof* → Secure against classical & quantum attacks.  
---
## 🧑‍💻 Features
- Quantum-Safe Key Distribution (QKD) demo.  
- Hack-detection via quantum disturbance simulation.  
- React-based UI for interactive experience.  
- Scalable design for *Quantum Internet backbone*.

## Technology stack

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

All shadcn/ui components have been downloaded under `@/components/ui`.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - HTML entry point
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration file
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration file
- `package.json` - NPM dependencies and scripts
- `src/app.tsx` - Root component of the project
- `src/main.tsx` - Project entry point
- `src/index.css` - Existing CSS configuration

## Components

- All shadcn/ui components are pre-downloaded and available at `@/components/ui`

## Styling

- Add global styles to `src/index.css` or create new CSS files as needed
- Use Tailwind classes for styling components

## Development

- Import components from `@/components/ui` in your React components
- Customize the UI by modifying the Tailwind configuration

## Note

The `@/` path alias points to the `src/` directory
